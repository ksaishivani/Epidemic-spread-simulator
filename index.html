        <h2>Introduction About The Project</h2> 
<p>
This project presents an interactive Epidemic Spread Simulator designed to
demonstrate how infectious diseases propagate through populations. The system
combines grid-based simulation, real-world population behavior, and the
mathematical SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model to visualize disease
transmission and recovery.</p>

<p>By allowing users to select between urban and rural population settings, the
project highlights how population density and human contact influence epidemic
dynamics. Real-time visual grids and population graphs help users understand
both microscopic (individual-level) and macroscopic (population-level) effects
of an epidemic.

    <h4>Population Graph Explanation</h4>
    <p>
        The population graph represents the epidemic progression using the
        SIR (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Blue Curve (Susceptible):</b> Number of people who are healthy but can get infected.</li>
        <li><b>Red Curve (Infected):</b> Number of people currently infected. This rises rapidly in urban areas.</li>
        <li><b>Green Curve (Recovered):</b> People who recovered and gained immunity.</li>
        <li><b>Orange Dotted Line:</b> Machine Learning–based prediction of future infection trend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The graph clearly shows how infection spreads, peaks, and eventually
        declines as recovery increases.

    <!-- EXPLANATION -->
   <div class="section explanation">
    <h3>Urban Population Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        Urban areas have high population density where individuals live and travel
        closely together. Due to frequent human interaction, the probability of
        disease transmission is high. This results in faster infection spread and
        larger outbreaks in a shorter time period.
    </p>

    <h3>Rural Population Behavior</h3>
    <p>
        Rural areas have low population density with limited daily contact between
        individuals. Due to physical distance and fewer interactions, the spread of
        disease is slower, resulting in smaller and delayed outbreaks compared to
        urban regions.
